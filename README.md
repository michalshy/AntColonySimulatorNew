# AntColonySimulator
 Ant colony simulator made with SFML and C++. The solution name is Neural Network, because project at the beginning was supposed to be something different :P

Now they can move and bounce off the walls, but I'm working on pheromones system and creating paths between colony and food they will search for

Press Left Mouse Button to draw walls (but don't draw them continously yet, it's very poorly optimized) and press Enter to start simulation :)

In work:
- optimization
- pheromones system
- food system
- reproduction system
